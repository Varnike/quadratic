# quadratic
study# Quadratic equasion solver
## Solve quadratic or linear equation if you want
## Features

- read coefficients from stdin
- it is easy to print solutions
- there are structures for storing coefficients and answers of quadratic equasion

## Compilation
You can compile programm with [g++]("https://gcc.gnu.org/") compiler:
```sh
g++ quadratic.cpp arithmetics.h arithmetics.cpp input.h input.cpp output.h output.cpp unitest.h unitest.cpp -o quadratic
```

## Run
To rum programm just run:
```sh
./quadratic
```
## Use
Enter three numbers: coefficients of quadratic equasion. Program will print number of solutions and solutions.
